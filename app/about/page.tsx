          <p>
            I’m an AI builder based in Singapore and co-founder of AI System
            Resources. Right now, I’m also learning what it takes to make it as
            a solopreneur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatelz.ai is where I share that process: the mindset I’m working
            on, the skills I’m developing and the things I’m actually building.
          </p>
          <p>
            The playbook comes from my own practice. I’m its first reader, its
            first experiment and, quite often, the person who needs the
            reminder.
